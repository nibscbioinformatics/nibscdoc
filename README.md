The goal of this package is to provide with basic templates for the key reports and documents produced by the Bioinformatics Core at NIBSC.


**Warning:** currently only the html report is fully functional.


## Installation

The package can be installed from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nibscbioinformatics/nibscdoc")
```

## Using from RStudio

The use of any templates is very easy on RStudio, once the package has been installed and RStudio has been restarted.

Just open File > New File > R Markdown > From Template and select the desired template.
